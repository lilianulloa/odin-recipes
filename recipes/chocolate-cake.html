    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The best chocolate cake recipe. Ever? There are plenty of claims for the best 
        chocolate cake recipe. I get that. But with one bite of this decadent, moist 
        chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, every single person around the table 
        commented that this was the best chocolate cake they’d ever tasted.</p>
    <p>So as for my house, this chocolate cake recipe now holds that honor.</p>
    <p>As the compliments continued, I didn’t begin to tell them how easy it was to make. 
        In all honesty, it is probably one of the easiest cakes I’ve made in a long time, 
        really, but I just smiled and thanked them.</p>
    <p> As we continued on gobbling up the cake, drinking our coffee or iced cold milk, the 
        compliments just kept coming.</p>
